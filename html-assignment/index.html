I have obtained my high school diploma from Ottawa Secondary School (OTSS). I also did additional credit courses
with Virtual High School (VHS). I am currently a student of Algonquin College studying Interactive 
Media Design (IMD). I love, basically, all the courses I am doing under my current program. One of my favourite quotation is by Robert H Schuller which states that:
